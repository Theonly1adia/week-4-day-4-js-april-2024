<h1>Objects</h1>

<p>With our 8 types in JavaScript we can represent data such as Numbers, Strings, and Booleans.</p>

<p>What if we want to represent several at once?</p>

<h3>Example Object</h3>

<p>A person might have a name</p>

<pre>
  let firstName = "edward";
</pre>

<p>A person might have a favorite ice cream flavor</p>

<pre>
  let iceCream = "pistachio";
</pre>


<p>JavaScript lets us put this together in an OBJECT with this syntax...</p>

<pre>
  // declare and assign
  let person = {
    name: "edward",
    iceCream: "pistachio"
  }; 

  // access properties of the object
  document.write(person.name);
  document.write(person.iceCream);

</pre>

<script>


  let person = {
    name: "edward",
    iceCream: "pistachio"
  }; 


  document.write("<br>");
  document.write(`${person.name} likes ${person.iceCream}`);
  document.write("<br>");
</script>

<h3> Practice </h3>

<img alt="diagram of people and favorite ice cream flavors" src="https://cdn.glitch.global/ebdf8985-2fba-44be-941c-615679018f75/objects-iceCream.jpg?v=1715894786180">

<p>TODO: Try assigning objects to variables.</p>

<script>
  let person1 = {
    name: "andy",
    iceCream: "choco"
  };

  let person2 = {
    name: "betty",
    iceCream: "pistachio"
  };
  // TODO: create objects and assign them below.
  let person3 = {
    name: "cathy",
    iceCream: "pistachio"
  };
  let person4 = {
    name: "danna",
    iceCream:"choco"
  };
  let person5 = {
    name: "edward",
    iceCream:"pistachio"
  };
  
  document.write(`${person1.name} likes ${person1.iceCream} <br>`)
  document.write(`${person2.name} likes ${person2.iceCream} <br>`)
  document.write(`${person3.name} likes ${person3.iceCream} <br>`)
  document.write(`${person4.name} likes ${person4.iceCream} <br>`)
  document.write(`${person5.name} likes ${person5.iceCream} <br>`)

</script>

<h3> More properties </h3>

<p>We can make objects with as many properties as we like. Let's try three.</p>

<pre>
  // re-assign person with 
  person = {
    name: "edward",
    iceCream: "pistachio",
    shirt: "green"
  };
</pre>

<p>TODO: Practice re-assigning all the people with a new object including shirt color.</p>

<script>
  person1 = {
    name: "andy",
    iceCream: "choco",
    shirt: "white"
  };

  // TODO: re-assign these variables
  person2 = {
    name: "betty",
    iceCream: "pistachio",
    shirt: "yellow"
  };
  person3 = {
    name: "cathy",
    iceCream: "pistachio",
    shirt: "green"
  };
  person4 = {
    name: "danna",
    iceCream: "choco",
    shirt: "yellow"
  };
  person5 = {
    name: "edward",
    iceCream: "pistachio",
    shirt: "green"
  };

  document.write(`${person1.name} likes ${person1.iceCream} and is wearing a ${person1.shirt} shirt <br>`)
  document.write(`${person2.name} likes ${person2.iceCream} and is wearing a ${person2.shirt} shirt <br>`)
  document.write(`${person3.name} likes ${person3.iceCream} and is wearing a ${person3.shirt} shirt <br>`)
  document.write(`${person4.name} likes ${person4.iceCream} and is wearing a ${person4.shirt} shirt <br>`)
  document.write(`${person5.name} likes ${person5.iceCream} and is wearing a ${person5.shirt} shirt <br>`)
 
  // TODO: write them all out


</script>

<h3>Try it out!</h3>

<p>Now, try to think of another object you can represent in computer code. It could be a cookie, a dog, an order, anything!</p>

<script>

  // TODO: make at least 5 objects and assign them to variables
  let car1= {
    make: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    year: "2024",
  }

  let car2 = {
    make: "BMW",
    model: "X3",
    year: "2019",
  }

  let car3 = {
    make: "Honda",
    model: "Civic",
    year: "2020",
  }

  let car4 = {
    make: "Volkswagen",
    model: "Beetle",
    year: "2006",
  }

  let car5 = {
    make: "Ford",
    model: "Mustang",
    year: "2015",
  }


  // TODO: write them out all to the document

  document.write(`This ${car1.make} ${car1.model} was made in ${car1.year}. <br>`)
  document.write(`This ${car2.make} ${car2.model} was made in ${car2.year}. <br>`)
  document.write(`This ${car3.make} ${car3.model} was made in ${car3.year}. <br>`)
  document.write(`This ${car4.make} ${car4.model} was made in ${car4.year}. <br>`)
  document.write(`This ${car5.make} ${car5.model} was made in ${car5.year}. <br>`)



</script>

<h2>Bonus: Objects and Arrays</h2>

<p>Arrays can contain any type: Strings, Booleans, Numbers...</p>

<p>Arrays can contain objects, too!</p>

<p> The syntax is confusing at first, but look carefully, and you'll see it.</p>

<pre>
  let catArray = [
    {
      name: "fluffy",
      breed: "persian"
    },
    {
      name: "eclipse",
      breed: "siamese"
    },
    {
      name: "luna",
      breed: "himalayan"
    }
  ]
</pre>

<h3>
  Challenge:
</h3>
<p>Try to create an array of your own objects. Then access them by index in the array. Then access the properties. Share with a partner if you get stuck.</p>

<script>
  // TODO: make an array of some object
  let capitalCityArray = [
    {
      state: "New York",
      capital: "Albany"
    },
    
    {
    state: "Louisiana",
    capital: "Baton Rouge"
    },
    {
      state: "Georgia",
      capital: "Atlanta"
    }
  ];

  // TODO: print them out to the document.
  // Think about combining what you know about arrays and objects. Ask for help if stuck!
  document.write("State:",capitalCityArray[0].state; "Capital:,capitalCityArray[0].capital")

</script>
